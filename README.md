# Light Up the Universe

The night is dark and cold, but it will be illuminated.  
We all have our own world, but no one is isolated.  
Let's work together to warm up each other and light up our universe.

## Rules:
In this game, you will have two grids. The goal is to light up all the empty cells in both of them. You can use light bulbs (light up horizontally and vertically). There are also pairs of “wormhole” connecting two grids. Light can go through “wormhole” and keep its direction.
Besides，
  1. you need to pay attention to the numbers on the black cells, which indicates the number of lights adjacent to them (above, below,        left and right)
  2. A light bulb can not be lit by other light bulbs.
